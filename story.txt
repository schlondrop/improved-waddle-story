John woke up one morning and decided to go to the park. After arriving at the park he saw his cousin who he hadn't seen for years. They chatted for a while before John went home.

John suddenly had a terrible feeling in his stomach as he remembered the blind rage he has towards his cousin. John had almost forgotten about his grudge against his cousin Jack he has had for 6 years.

John decided it was time do something about his absolute hatred towards his cousin. He went to his garage to gather some appliances for the task. After a while of contemplating the deed, John left with a gas can, a pair of rustly pliers, an axe, some rope and a car battery so he would have some options.

John exited with his tools, and decided to douce the entire house in gasoline.  He then lit the match and watched the house burn down. John wasn't feeling right, he realized his garage had been filled with loopy gas and he inhaled a large amount.  After further inspection, John realized he burned down his own house.
